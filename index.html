              <span>My Interests In</span>
              <h2>Information Technology</h2>
              <p>My interest in IT is in security, software and hardware. I first developed my interest in IT a quite a long time ago when I first found that there were various aspects of IT and the various number of things that can be done with IT. Some of the IT experience I have had on the software side of things are programming small programs with visual basic and python, I also have had experience in developing a website for a client as a VCE assignment. On the hardware side of things, I have had experience in building my own custom PC as well as fixing some damaged laptops. I chose to study at RMIT because I enjoy being in the city and heard that the education for IT at RMIT was good. The things that I expect to learn during my studies is knowledge that would allow me to specialise is an aspect of IT.

                <p>To me the test presents the generic attributes for a person, although I do not believe that every single detail of the test is true as some of the questions can be confusing to the person taking the test as it can be unrelatable to them.</p><p>
                I don’t think that the results of the test can influence my behaviour in a team as I can behave differently depending on who I work with.</p><p>
                Although I said that the results may not reflect every detail about the person, while forming a team I should consider the results of other as it will show what that person is like, their way of learning and how it can be beneficial towards how the team work together.
