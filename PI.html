            <h3 class="h4">Overview</h3>
            <p>The project idea that I have is to develop a mobile application that detects the user’s location and mutes their phone depending on where they are. This will allow the user to go to a location where their phones will need to be silenced and the phone will automatically mute itself in the case that the user forgets to mute their phone. To develop this application the programming language that will need to be used is C++, as it has a large library and is efficient. </p>
            <h3 class="h4">Motivation</h3>
            <p>This project seems like an interesting idea because during my years studying at school, university or at events, there has been many times where there has been the occasion where someone’s phone would ring during the times when it should have been on silence. Having a phone ring during silence can become distracting to the user and to the people around them. The project idea that I have would allow the user’s phone to silence itself in the case that it is in a location that requires it to be.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Description</h3>
            <p>My mobile silencing app will be called “Sylant”. The mobile application will require the user to input locations where they want the app to be activated. The app will have 3 modes; school, work, stealth. In school mode, the application detects if the user is in an area which the user has set to a school, and therefore the app will activate once the user has entered a school area and will silence all incoming notifications from all social media apps such as, Facebook, Instagram, snapchat, etc., entertainment apps like games and YouTube as well as all incoming calls and messages.. When in work mode, the application will again detect if the user has entered an area that the user has set as their work place. While in work mode the application will silence some social media application (exceptions such as email and work-related social media), all entertainment services and some incoming messages and calls, only allowing calls and messages from people the user has set as important. However, in Stealth mode, every notification will be silenced. To make the three modes more flexible, the app will need to allow the user to select the days and time in a week where the modes are to become active when the user enters the set areas, this will allow the user to still enter the set areas and not have their notifications muted. To enable these features, the app will need permission to access the user’s contacts and messages, location, calendar, clock, and other app notifications. This is so that the can app function, as without the permission the app will not know the location of the user, and the notifications that are passing through their phone. Another two features that the app will provide will be called “Lockdown” and “Study buddy” this is when the user can limit themselves from their phone for a set period to stop themselves from getting distracted. When using the feature “Lockdown”, the app will completely block notifications to the user, and their phone will only let the user see the time and date on a black wallpaper. This way the user will not be able to see any notification that pops up and therefore become less distracted if there was a notification on the lock screen. On the other hand, the feature “Study buddy” will silence all notifications from apps and will only allow important incoming phone calls and messages. However, “Study buddy” will allow to use all apps on their phone with the condition of using it for only 30 minutes at a time with a cooldown of 1 hour at default with other options the user can choose from (use for 1 hour with a cooldown of 2 hours 45 minutes or use for 15 minutes with a cooldown of 45minutes). The features from this app is targeted to assist the user in not getting distracted by silencing notification, disabling the phone completely or to have set periods in which the user can use their phones at a time.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Tools and Technology</h3>
            <p>The tools and Technology that I will need to create this program in terms of software will be a source code editor (Atom or Sublime Text) which will enable me to write the program in C++, I will also need to download the Native Development Kit (Terminal IDE) to compile and run the program on an android mobile device. In terms of Hardware I will need a laptop to write then compile all the code and a mobile device to test the program on.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Skills Required</h3>
            <p>The skills that will be required to create this application are:</p>
            <p>-	Time management as the application will take a while to create</p>
            <p>-	Familiarity with the C++ language</p>
            <p>-	Proficiency with using a computer/laptop</p>
            <p>-	Familiarity with the use of a Native Development Kit (ideally Terminal IDE)</p>
            <p>I think that the skills for this project may or may not be feasible as there is much to learn if someone is not familiarised with the C++ language.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Outcome</h3>
            <p>If this project was to become successful, the original problem that was faced would become less of a problem as this application can be accessed by anyone with an android phone which would mean that they can choose to use the application be become less distracted by their mobile phones. The impact of this development will have is going to benefit those who are frequently distracted by their phone as the application will assist them in ignoring their phones.</p>
